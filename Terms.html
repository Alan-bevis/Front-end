            5. Project Timelines
            Project timelines are estimates and are subject to change based on the scope of work, client feedback, and other factors. We will communicate any changes to the timeline promptly. Delays caused by the client, including late provision of materials or feedback, may result in extended project timelines.
            <br>
            6. Revisions and Modifications
            We offer [Number] rounds of revisions included in the initial project cost. Additional revisions or significant changes to the project scope may incur extra charges.

            7. Intellectual Property
            Upon full payment, the client will own the final web development project. However, we reserve the right to showcase the project in our portfolio and marketing materials.

            <br>
            9. Warranties and Liability
            We strive to deliver high-quality web development services, but we do not guarantee that the project will be free from errors or interruptions. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the developed website or services. The client agrees to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from the use of the website.
            <br>
            10. Termination
            Either party may terminate the project at any time with written notice. In the event of termination, the client agrees to pay for all work completed up to the date of termination.

            14. Entire Agreement
