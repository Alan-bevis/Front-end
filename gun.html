                Assault rifle, military firearm that is chambered for ammunition of reduced size or propellant charge and that has the capacity to switch between semiautomatic and fully automatic fire. Because they are light and portable yet still able to deliver a high volume of fire with reasonable accuracy at modern combat ranges of 1,000‚Äì1,600 feet (300‚Äì500 metres), assault rifles have replaced the high-powered bolt-action and semiautomatic rifles of the World War II era as the standard infantry weapon of modern armies.

Functional components of an automatic rifle, as illustrated by the M16 assault rifle.
A hint at this new weapon had been given during World War I, when Vladimir Grigorevich Fyodorov, father of Russian automatic weapons, married the 6.5-mm cartridge of the Japanese Arisaka rifle to an automatic rifle. In 1916 he unveiled his new weapon, the Avtomat Fyodorova. Owing to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution of 1917, only about 3,200 of Fyodorov‚Äôs weapons were delivered. Nevertheless, they pointed the way to future infantry weapon design

       <h2> Sub Machine Gun</h2>
       <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(7, 7, 7);color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
              Submachine gun, lightweight automatic small-arms weapon chambered for relatively low-energy pistol cartridges and fired from the hip or shoulder. Most types utilize simple blowback actions. Using cartridges of such calibres as .45 inch or 9 mm, they usually have box-type magazines that hold from 10 to 50 cartridges, or occasionally drums holding more rounds. A short-range weapon, the submachine gun is rarely effective at more than 200 yards (180 m). It fires at rates as high as 650 or more rounds per minute and weighs 6 to 10 pounds (2.5 to 4.5 kg).

              Developed during World War I, the submachine gun came into great demand during World War II because of the need to increase the individual soldier‚Äôs firepower at close quarters. The Germans developed the first such weapons, modeling them to some extent after the Italian double-barreled Villar Perosa, or VP, a 1915 innovation that fired so fast it emptied its magazine in two seconds. The Germans identified their weapon, the first true submachine gun, as the MP18, or the Bergmann Muskete. This weapon was first issued in 1918, the last year of World War I. In Britain submachine guns came to be called machine carbines; in Germany, machine pistols; in the United States, submachine guns. The Thompson submachine gun (q.v.), or tommy gun, an important American type, was patented in 1920. After 1925 numerous evolutionary models appeared: the Bergmann Model 34 and the Schmeisser 28 II in Germany, Italy‚Äôs Beretta Model 38, and the Hungarian Model 43. During and after World War II, many new types and models appeared: the British 9 mm Sten gun; the Soviet 7.62 mm PPSh M1941 and PPS M1943; the German Schmeisser MP38 and MP40; the Israeli Uzi submachine gun (q.v.); the Czech Model 23; and the American M3, a .45-inch calibre, nine-pound weapon called the ‚Äúgrease gun‚Äù because it resembled the device used to grease automobiles

       <h2>Light Machine Gun</h2>
       <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(7, 7, 7);color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Light Machine Gun (LMG) is a crucial type of automatic firearm, specifically designed to provide sustained and effective suppressive fire, which is vital for infantry combat operations. Unlike heavier machine guns that require multiple operators and a fixed position, the LMG is designed for portability and can be operated by a single soldier, enhancing its utility in various combat scenarios. This portability is often facilitated by a bipod, which provides stability when firing from a prone position, allowing the operator to maintain a steady stream of fire while minimizing recoil. The LMG's design includes features that support continuous fire, such as belt-fed or high-capacity magazine-fed ammunition systems, enabling it to deliver a high rate of fire over extended periods without frequent reloading. This capability makes the LMG indispensable for roles such as providing covering fire for advancing troops, defending positions against enemy assaults, and creating strategic advantages on the battlefield. Notable examples of LMGs include the M249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) used by the U.S. military, renowned for its reliability, ease of use, and effective range. The FN Minimi, another well-known LMG, exemplifies similar qualities and has seen widespread use in various military forces around the world. These weapons are designed to be robust and adaptable to different combat environments, whether in open fields, urban settings, or dense forests. The effectiveness of LMGs in providing mobile, heavy firepower has solidified their place in modern military arsenals, offering a balance between the firepower of heavier machine guns and the maneuverability of lighter infantry weapons.</p>

        <h2>Sniper</h2>
        <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(7, 7, 7);color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A sniper rifle is a high-precision, long-range firearm designed for use by specially trained soldiers known as snipers. These rifles are engineered to deliver accurate and lethal fire at distances far exceeding those achievable by standard infantry weapons, often targeting individual enemies or critical equipment. Sniper rifles are characterized by their precision-engineered barrels, advanced optics, and adjustable stocks, allowing for exceptional accuracy over great distances. The role of a sniper extends beyond marksmanship; it involves extensive training in stealth, reconnaissance, and ballistics to effectively engage targets while remaining concealed. Sniper rifles are equipped with powerful scopes that provide high magnification and sometimes include range-finding capabilities, windage adjustments, and ballistic calculators to assist the shooter in making accurate long-range shots. Examples of sniper rifles include the M40, used by the U.S. Marine Corps, and the Barrett M82, known for its ability to engage targets at extreme distances with its .50 caliber rounds. These rifles are designed to be highly customizable, allowing snipers to tailor their weapons to specific mission requirements and personal preferences. The strategic role of snipers in modern military operations includes gathering intelligence, providing overwatch and support for infantry units, and neutralizing high-value targets, which can significantly impact the outcome of engagements. Sniper operations require a combination of patience, precision, and psychological resilience, as snipers often operate independently or in small teams, relying on their skills and equipment to remain undetected and effective in hostile environments. The development of sniper rifles continues to evolve with advancements in materials, optics, and ballistics, ensuring that these weapons remain at the forefront of precision shooting technology.</p>

        <h2>Shotgun</h2>
        <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(1, 1, 1);color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">A shotgun is a versatile, smoothbore firearm designed to fire a spread of projectiles, known as shot, or single large slugs. Unlike rifles, which fire a single bullet with high velocity and accuracy over long distances, shotguns are engineered to deliver a spread of pellets or a single slug, making them effective at close to medium ranges. This spread increases the likelihood of hitting a target, which is especially useful in situations where precision at longer ranges is less critical. Shotguns are commonly used in a variety of applications, including hunting, sport shooting, and military or law enforcement scenarios. They are available in various gauges, with the most common being 12-gauge, 20-gauge, and .410 bore, each offering different levels of power and recoil. The design of a shotgun typically includes a smoothbore barrel, which lacks the rifling found in rifles, allowing the shot to spread out upon firing. Many shotguns are also designed to be versatile, with interchangeable barrels and chokes that can modify the spread of the shot to suit different needs. For instance, a full choke tightens the spread for greater range, while a cylinder choke offers a wider spread for close-range use. Notable examples of shotguns include the Remington 870 and the Mossberg 500, both renowned for their durability and reliability in various conditions. In military and law enforcement contexts, shotguns are valued for their stopping power and effectiveness in breaching doors or engaging targets in confined spaces. The shotgun's design allows for a range of ammunition types, including buckshot, which is effective for personal defense and tactical situations, and birdshot, which is commonly used for hunting. Additionally, some shotguns are capable of firing slug rounds, which provide the stopping power of a rifle bullet but with the versatility of a shotgun. This adaptability, combined with the wide range of ammunition options, makes the shotgun a valuable tool in both civilian and professional applications.</p>

        <h2>Pistols</h2>
        <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(1, 1, 1);color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">A pistol is a type of handgun designed for one-handed operation, offering a balance of power, accuracy, and portability. Pistols come in various designs, but they generally fall into two main categories: semi-automatic and revolver. Semi-automatic pistols use a recoil-operated or gas-operated mechanism to automatically cycle the action and chamber the next round after each shot, allowing for rapid successive firing. These pistols typically feature detachable magazines that can hold multiple rounds, making them well-suited for both self-defense and tactical use. Notable examples include the Glock 17, known for its reliability and simplicity, and the Beretta 92, valued for its accuracy and ergonomic design.

            Revolvers, on the other hand, use a rotating cylinder to hold multiple rounds, with each chamber rotating into alignment with the barrel for firing. Revolvers are known for their durability and simplicity, often requiring less maintenance than semi-automatics. They typically hold fewer rounds than semi-automatic pistols but are favored for their reliability and ease of use. Examples include the Smith & Wesson Model 686 and the Colt Python, both celebrated for their performance and craftsmanship.
            
            Pistols are used in a variety of contexts, including self-defense, law enforcement, military applications, and sport shooting. They are valued for their compact size and ease of concealment compared to rifles and shotguns, making them a popular choice for personal protection. Pistols also offer a range of calibers and configurations to suit different needs, from small-caliber models ideal for concealed carry to larger, more powerful variants designed for duty use or target shooting. The versatility and widespread use of pistols have made them a cornerstone of modern firearm design, with ongoing advancements in technology and materials continuing to enhance their performance and usability.</p>

            <h2>Launchers</h2>
            <p style="border: #09FF00;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;background-color: rgb(1, 1, 1);color: rgb(247, 247, 247);">Launchers are specialized weapons designed to project explosive projectiles, typically rockets or grenades, over distances to engage targets that are beyond the effective range of conventional firearms. These weapons come in various forms and are used for both military and tactical purposes. 

                **RPGs (Rocket-Propelled Grenades)**: One of the most well-known types of launchers, RPGs are shoulder-fired weapons that use rocket propulsion to deliver a high-explosive warhead to a target. The RPG-7, a widely used model, is known for its simplicity, effectiveness, and the ability to fire a variety of warheads, including anti-tank and fragmentation rounds. RPGs are valued for their portability and capability to defeat armored vehicles and fortifications.
                
                **Grenade Launchers**: These devices are designed to fire grenades at higher velocities than hand-thrown grenades. They come in both standalone versions and those integrated with rifles. Examples include the M203 and M320, which can be mounted under the barrel of an M16 or M4 rifle, allowing soldiers to launch grenades accurately over long distances. Grenade launchers are effective for delivering explosive or smoke rounds into enemy positions, creating diversions, or providing indirect fire support.
                
                **Mortar Systems**: While technically different from shoulder-fired launchers, mortars are indirect fire weapons that launch explosive shells in a high-arc trajectory. Mortars vary in size and range, with portable models like the 60mm mortar used by infantry for close support, and larger models like the 120mm mortar used for longer-range engagements. Mortars are effective for providing artillery support and can be used to target enemy positions from behind cover or terrain.
                
                **Shoulder-Fired Anti-Tank Weapons**: These include systems like the Javelin or the AT4, designed to defeat armored vehicles with high-precision, guided missiles. They combine advanced targeting systems with powerful warheads to penetrate vehicle armor and are crucial for modern infantry units facing armored threats.
                
                Launchers are integral to modern military operations, providing forces with the capability to engage a wide range of targets from a distance.
